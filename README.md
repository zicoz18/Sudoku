# Sudoku
This program creates SuDoKu puzzles that has uniqe solutions

For the first version there might be unnecessary methods, and solution might not be the most efficient one, but at the end code does the job.

Creates a sudoku puzlle with a uniqe solution using sudoku solver I have written.

Uniqe solution existance, means no more than 1 solutions exits and a certain solution exits.
