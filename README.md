# Sudoku
This program creates SuDoKu puzzles that has uniqe solutions and creates the solution.
 
Right know this is a command line project, I will be working on the GUI in near future.

For the first version there might be some unnecessary methods, and solution might not be the most efficient one, but at the end code does do the job.


Creates a sudoku puzlle with a uniqe solution using sudoku solver I have written.
Uniqe solution existance, means no more than 1 solutions exits and a certain solution exits.
